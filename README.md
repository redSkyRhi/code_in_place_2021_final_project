# code_in_place_2021_final_project
My first ever code project.

This is a small bit of code that enabled me to create a structured shopping list from a .json file containing a dictionary of various big batch cooks that I regularly make.
I wanted it to give me the option to select multiple batch cooks, then work out how much of each ingredient I would need overall. The final shopping list is broken up into categories that reflect the different areas of a supermarket to make my shopping experience easier.

I completed this as my final project for the code in place 2021 course which was run by Stanford university and i would like to give them a BIG thank you for the amazing teaching and opportunity to learn.

I have only recently started to look into coding and, before this course, have never written a program or used python. So although it is a basic programme I am very proud of myself for doing it.

I would welcome any constructive comments or pointers anyone feels inclined to give.
